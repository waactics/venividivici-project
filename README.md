## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- Understanding the API flow interactions were challenging to grasp at first but I had help breaking it down to simple terms thankfully
- I kept getting a console error but I identified that it had to do with the way I was formatting the fetch call so I was able to fix it
